#### Connecting Los Angeles creatives

This is a networking app that makes it easier for those in the creative industry to find each other, for free. Users can post the talent or creative professional they need for their projects. All advertised positions are unpaid jobs.

This is the capstone project for my [Bloc](http://bloc.io) apprenticeship.
